One major issue is that passing different parameters to these constructors create different types (tensors with traits (matrix multiplication) and tensor functions). There's some relationship between definition of a convolutional network and what type of value (usually not a fixed type, but rather a set of types (infinite)) it can accept and return.\n# So I propose or want to know how we can let Erg to solve this long-standing problem, by letting the static typechecker to know the type of `torch.nn.Conv2d` and emit errors before execution? Help can be found by:\n# ```python\n# import torch\n# help(torch.nn.Conv2d)\n# ```"

It mentions the use of ROS for control-related packages and provides information about power control through `/dev/serial/by-id/*`. Users need to install pyserial. For HID (Human Interface Device) control, it suggests using `hidapi` from pypi with kcom2/kcom3 or ch9329 and provides links to related projects.

The \"Connection\" class represents a connection between two neurons with properties like connected index, weights, and bias. The \"Neuron\" class represents a neuron with properties such as its index, current potential, input connections, and output connections. It also has a method called \"forward_propagate\" that performs weighted sum of inputs, adds the connection's bias, and applies an activation function to calculate the neuron's new potential.",

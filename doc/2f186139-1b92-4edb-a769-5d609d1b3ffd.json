It considers using website visuals instead of OBS and discusses the use of WebSocket protocol to send messages with time-aligned events. The code also mentions using a shell environment, REPL, and Docker containers. Additionally, it highlights that playwright cannot record/listen to mouse events, so an OS-specific keylogger can be used instead if the events are fired within the browser's effective area.",

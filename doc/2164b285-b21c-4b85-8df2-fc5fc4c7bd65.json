The author is considering whether it can be batched but acknowledges that it may be slower. They suggest that this approach could allow the model to backpropagate and return the best state, but they note uncertainties about having an explicit or implicit reward function. They mention that once the model learns to undo its generated tokens, consciousness might come up.",

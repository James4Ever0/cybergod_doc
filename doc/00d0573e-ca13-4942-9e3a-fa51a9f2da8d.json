    "summary": "The code performs a 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on two arrays, then combines the results using both addition and element-wise multiplication before performing an inverse FFT to obtain the final result. The author is printing various results for comparison, including the original data, addition result, multiplication result, and sum of the two operations. The code ends by discarding imaginary parts due to strange values obtained in the process.",

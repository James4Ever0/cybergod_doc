It can help identify weak and common passwords quickly.       \n4) Hybrid attacks - These combine multiple methods above in order to increase the probability of finding a password with a brute-force approach.\nResults: The original ASCII image did not have any significant difference in terms of content, such as text or images, from the converted PNG format.
